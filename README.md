Hi this is my first data analytic self-project
I looked up for running sports data from kaggle that good to be use
Learning and undestanding by asking AI dan search from google for syntax

MOVE TO MAIN PROJECT TOPICS
What I want to know from the data?
POV if I were the event manager?

1. How was the event going? Is it clear?
2. How was the operational? any challange? 
3. How was the performance of runners/athletes? How good it is?
4. How was the feedback from sponsorship, etc?

What data we have?
Name, Class, BIB, Country, 3.9K (Checkpoint), Chip Time, Finish Time
So what we can analyze is performance.

I want to know the:
1. Overall pace
2. Finish, DNF/DNS
3. Country avg pace
4. Category avg pace

Another data that I want to know?
1. DNF or DNS? Check the Start Time (not exist)
2. Any Fraud? Check 3.9K Checkpoint and Start Time
3. Podium name for 1-3 with every category
Will be conduct next if it wanted to be analyze

Now focus for the performance
